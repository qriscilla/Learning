How JSX works
  - stands for JavaScript XML
  - allows us to write HTML in JavaScript and place them in the DOM
  - converts HTML tags into react elements
  - is an extension of the JavaScript language based on ES6
  - is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime
  
How to write JSX
  - write the expression inside {curly braces}
  - expression can be a React variable, or property, or any other valid JavaScript expression
  - Elements must be closed with />
  - To write HTML on multiple lines, put the HTML inside parentheses
    E.g.,
        const myelement = (
          <ul>
            <li>Apples</li>
            <li>Bananas</li>
            <li>Cherries</li>
          </ul>
        );
        
One Top Level Element
  -  Have two headers? Must put them inside a parent element, like a div element
    E.g.,
        const myelement = (
          <div>
            <h1>I am a Header.</h1>
            <h1>I am a Header too.</h1>
          </div>
        );
