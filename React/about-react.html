About React
  - a JS library created by Facebook
  - often called a framework because of its behavior and capabilities
  - is the view in MVC (Model-view-controller)
  - used for building UIs and front-end apps
  
Works in components
  - e.g., In a to do list app, it would have multiple components:
    search enginer component, list of tasks component, each task component, add to do component
  - Components can have state, which is an object that determines how that component renders and behaves
  - Can have "application level" state by using a state manager (e.g., Redux or Reacts own context API)
  
Create React App
  - a command line (CLI) tool for creating React apps
  - uses Webpack, but needs no additional configuration
  - comes bundled with a dev server with hot reload (i.e., auto-reload as you save)
  - "npm run build" to compile all your code to something that the browser can read
  
Anotmy of a component
  - Class-based components can have life-cycle methods
  E.g.,
  <script>
  Class Post extends React.Component { // Class called post that extends the component class in React library
    state = { // Creating a state object with different key value pairs
    title: "Post One",
    body: "This is my post"
    }
    render() { // the only required life-cycle method that takes care of rendering components on the page
    return {
    <div> // JSX (JavaScript XML) starts here. Kind of looks like HTML!
      <h3>{ this.state.title }</h3> // JS expressions embedded directly in the markup
      <p>{ this.state.body }</p>
    </div>
    }
    }
  }
  </script>
