Overview of NPM (Node Package Manager)
  - Comes with Node.js
  - Allows us to easily install packages or modules (JS libraries)
  - https://www.npmjs.com/ has open-source NPM modules

package.json
  - Probably the most important file in Node.js!
  - It's a manifest file with info about the app (name, author, description, etc.)
  - Lists all the app dependencies (modules the app needs it to work) and their versions
  - (e.g., "main": "index.js") Main is the entry point 
  - (e.g., "start": "node index.js") runs the specified file, so one doesn't need to go in and check "main"

Commands
  npm                               brings up the help page and gives a list of all the npm commands
  npm -v                            (or npm --version) to see the version of NPM installed on your system
  npm init                          creates a package.json file
  npm init -y                       (or npm init --yes) makes a package.json file and accepts all the default answers
  npm get init                      (e.g., npm get init-author-name) checks what the default answer is for a specified field
  npm set                           (e.g., npm set init-license "MIT") changes the default answer for a specified field
  npm config delete                 (e.g., npm config delete init-author-name) deletes the default answer for a specified field
  npm install <module> --save       saves the module as a dependency in package.json
  npm install <module> --save-dev   saves the module as a dev dependency you'll only use in the dev environment
  npm install --production          saves all necessary modules except for the ones listed under dev dependencies
  npm uninstall <module>            uninstalls the module
  npm remove <module>               (or npm rm <module>) removes all the module aliases
  npm update <module>               updates the module to the latest minor version
  npm install -g <module>           installs the module globally
  npm root -g                       tells you where all your global modules go/went
  npm remove -g <module>            removes the global module
  npm list                          lists all the dependencies in the app
  npm list --depth <number>         lists all the dependencies at a specified level (e.g., 0)
  
Example - Lodash (a module that e.g., iterates arrays, objects, and strings)
  <script>
    // Install Lodash
    npm install lodash --save

    // In the main file,
    const _ = require('lodash');              // _ is the convention for lodash
                                              // bring in the module you installed by requiring it
    const numbers = [33, 46, 75];             // a simple array variable with a few random numbers
    _.each(numbers, function(number, i){      // loop through using .each() function
      console.log(number);
    });
    
    // In vanilla JS, it would look like this
    var numbers = [33, 46, 75];
    for(var i=0; i<numbers.length; i++){
      console.log(numbers[i]);
    }
    
    // Anyway, back to command line, run
    node index.js                             // or just node index
    
    // output:
    33
    46
    75
  </script>

Semantic Versioning
  E.g., 8.2.6
        8     Major version
              Careful! Will break the application
        2     Minor version
              E.g., Adding a new feature
              Should not break anything in the application
        6     Patch
              E.g., A bug fix
              Should not break anything in the application

When installing an updated version,
  E.g.,   "lodash": "4.17.4"      Will download the exact version (4.17.4)
          "lodash": "^4.17.4"     Will download the latest minor version
          "lodash": "~4.17.4"     Will download the latest patch version

Global Modules
  - When installed, doesn't go inside the node module or the package.json. It gets installed on the computer globally
  - Nodemon is usually downloaded globally

Local Modules
  - When installed, goes inside the node module and package.json
