Overview of NPM (Node Package Manager)
  - Comes with Node.js
  - Allows us to easily install packages or modules (JS libraries)
  - https://www.npmjs.com/ has open-source NPM modules

In command line, run
  npm                   brings up the help page and gives a list of all the npm commands
  npm -v                (or npm --version) to see the version of NPM installed on your system
  npm init              creates a package.json file
  npm init -y           (or npm init --yes) to make a package.json file and accept all the default answers
  npm config set        (e.g., npm config set init-author-name "Priscilla Whang") will update the specified field
  npm set               (e.g., npm set init-license "MIT") changes the default answer for a specified field

package.json
  - Probably the most important file in Node.js!
  - It's a manifest file with info about the app (name, author, description, etc.)
  - Lists all the app dependencies (modules the app needs it to work) and their versions
