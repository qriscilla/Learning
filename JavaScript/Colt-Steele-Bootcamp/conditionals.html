One of the most important concepts in programming!

3 JS conditional keywords:
  if - takes a single condition and runs code block if it is true
  else if - follows an if-statement and is a secondary condition
  else - "otherwise"; run code block if none of the above conditions were met
  
Club Bouncer Example

  If you are younger than 18
    you cannot enter the club
  If you are between 18 and 21
    you can enter but cannot drink
  Otherwise
    you can enter and drink

  <script>
    if(age < 18) {
      console.log("Sorry, you're not old enough to enter the club.")
    } else if(age < 21) {
      console.log("You can enter, but cannot drink.")
    } else {
      console.log("Come on in. You can drink.")
    }
  </script>

Exercise

  If age is negative
    print an error message

  If age is 21
    print "Happy 21st birthday!"

  If age is odd
    print "Your age is odd!"

  Super bonus: If age is a perfect square,
    print "Your age is a perfect square!"

  <script>

    var age = Num(prompt("How old are you?"))
    
    if(age < 0) {
      console.log("You can't be negative years old!")
    }
    
    if(age === 21) {
      console.log("Happy 21st birthday!")
    }
    
    if( (age % 2) !== 0 ) {
      console.log("Your age is odd!")
    }
    
    if( age % Math.sqrt(age) === 0) {
      console.log("Your age is a perfect square!")
    }
    
  </script>
