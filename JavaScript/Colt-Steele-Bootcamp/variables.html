Variables are simply containers that store values (number, string, boolean, null, undefined)!

They follow this pattern:
  <script>    var variableName = value;   
              var name = "Rusty";        
              var secretNumber = 73;      
              var isAdorable = true;      </script>
              
Can update existing variables (their values or even their datatypes)
** JS has "dynamic typing", so it can change from one datatype to another **
  <script>    var num = "fifty";
                  num = 50;               </script>
                  
JS follows lower camelCase as a convention: variableName, secretNumber, isAdorable
