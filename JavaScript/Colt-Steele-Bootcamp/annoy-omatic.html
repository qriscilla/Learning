Objective:
  Ask the user "Are we there yet"
  Keep asking again and again until they enter "yes" or "yeah"
  Then, alert "Yay, we finally made it!"
  
  <script>

          var answer = prompt("Are we there yet?");

          while(answer !== "yes" && answer !== "yeah") {
            var answer = prompt("Are we there yet?");
          }

          // This code will only run after the while loop is over!
          alert("Yay, we finally made it!");

  </script>
  
  
  
  
Bonus:
  A user can enter any string as long as it contains "yes" in it
  
  <script>

          var answer = prompt("Are we there yet?");

          // while "yes" doesn't exist inside the answer
          while(answer.indexOf("yes") === -1) {
            var answer = prompt("Are we there yet?");
          }

          // This code will only run after the while loop is over!
          alert("Yay, we finally made it!");

  </script>
