5 Primitive Datatypes:

1. Numbers
  - Examples: 4, 9.3, -10
  - JS doesn't differentiate between different types of number - whole, decimal, negative, etc.  
  - Modulo % "mod"
      Remainder operator
      Examples: 
        10 % 3 will     1
        20 % 5 will     0
      
2. Strings
  - Examples: "Hello World", '43'
  - Can be 'single' or "double" quotes
  
  - Concatenation
      Just like numbers, we can concatenate strings
      Example: 
        "hi " + "goodbye"     "hi goodbye"
        
  - Escape characters \
      Add backslash to write special characters inside strings
      Example: 
        "She said \"goodbye!\" "      "She said "goodbye!" "
        "This is a backslash: \\"     "This is a backslash: \"
        
  - Strings have a length property
      Example:
        "hello world".length      11

  - Access individual characters using [] and an index
      Remember, the first character is counted as index 0
      Examples:
        "hello[0]"      "h"
        "hello[4]"      "o"
  
3. Booleans
  - true or false
    
4. Null
  
5. Undefined
