5 Primitive Datatypes:

  1. Numbers
    - Examples: 4, 9.3, -10
    - JS doesn't differentiate between different types of number - whole, decimal, negative, etc.  
    - Modulo % "mod"
        Remainder operator
        Examples: 
          10 % 3 will     1
          20 % 5 will     0

  2. Strings
    - Examples: "Hello World", '43'
    - Can be 'single' or "double" quotes

    - Concatenation
        Just like numbers, we can concatenate strings
        Example: 
          "hi " + "goodbye"     "hi goodbye"

    - Escape characters \
        Add backslash to write special characters inside strings
        Example: 
          "She said \"goodbye!\" "      "She said "goodbye!" "
          "This is a backslash: \\"     "This is a backslash: \"

    - Strings have a length property
        Example:
          "hello world".length      11

    - Access individual characters using [] and an index
        Remember, the first character is counted as index 0
        Examples:
          "hello"[0]      "h"
          "hello"[4]      "o"

  3. Booleans
    - true or false

  4. Null

  5. Undefined

Primitive Exercises

  Evaluate the following statements without running them in a console:

    1. 100 % 3                                 1
                                               3 * 33 = 99
                                               100 - 99 = 1

    2. ("blah" + "blah")[6]                    "a"
                                               "blah" + "blah" = "blahblah"
                                               "blahblah"[6] = "a"

    3. "hello".length % "hi\\".length           2
                                                "hello".length = 5
                                                "hi\\" = "hi\"
                                                "hi\".length = 3
                                                5 % 3 = 2
