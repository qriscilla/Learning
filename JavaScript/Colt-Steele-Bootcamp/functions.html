Functions are the most important aspect of JS!

Functions Overview
  - Lets us wrap bits of code up into reusable packages
  - Has a 2-step process:
    <script>
            // 1. Declare the function.               2. Call (execute) the function.
                function doSomething() {                 doSomething(); // The parantheses here are important to actually execute the function!
                  console.log("Hello world");            doSomething;   // Without the parantheses, the console would just recall the function structure.
                }
    </script>
