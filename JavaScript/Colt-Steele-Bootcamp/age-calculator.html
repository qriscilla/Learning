Age Calculator - Enter your age and find out how many days you've been alive.

<script>
  var age = prompt("How old are you?");
  var days = age * 365.25;
  console.log(age + "years is roughly " + days " days.");
</script>

To take into leap year, which happens every 4 years, we added the 0.25 decimal at the end of 365.
