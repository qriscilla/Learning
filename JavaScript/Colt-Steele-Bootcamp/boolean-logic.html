Comparison Operators

                  For example, asssume x = 5
  Operator      Name                          Example       Result
  >             Greater than                  x > 10        false
  >=            Greater than or equal to      x >= 5        true
  <             Less than                     x < -50       false
  <=            Less than or equal to         x <= 100      true
  
  ==            Equal to                      x == "5"      true        x is a number 5, but it equals the value of string 5
  !=            Not equal to                  x != "b"      true
  
  ===           Equal value and type          x === "5"     false
  !==           Not equal value or type       x !== "5"     true
  
  A note about == vs. ===
    == performs type coercion (converts the values being compared into a similar type, to make them comparable)
    === does not perform type coercion

    Examples:     var x = 99;                   
                  x == "99"           true            
                  x === "99"          false           

                  var y = null
                  y == undefined      true
                  y === undefined     false

                  true == "1"         true
                  true == "12"        false

                  0 == false          true

                  null == undefined   true

                  NaN == NaN          false     Not-a-number is not comparable to a not-a-number
