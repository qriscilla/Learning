JOIN overview
  - used to combine rows from two or more tables, based on a related column between them
  - think of it as two tables "joining" where they repeat the same column
  
(INNER) JOIN
  - returns records that have matching values in both tables
  
  SELECT column 
  FROM table1 
  INNER JOIN table2 
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  
  e.g., all orders with customer information
        SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customer.CustomerName 
        FROM Orders 
        INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID;
        
  e.g., all orders with customer and shipper information between three tables
        SELECT Orders.OrderID, Customer.CustomerName, Shipper.ShipperName 
        FROM ((Orders
        INNER JOIN Customers ON Orders.CustomerID = Customers.CustomerID)
        INNER join shippers ON Orders.ShipperID = Shippers.ShipperID);
  
LEFT (OUTER) JOIN
  - returns all records from the left table, and the matched records from the right table
  - If there is no match, the result will be NULL
  
  SELECT column
  FROM table1
  LEFT JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  
RIGHT (OUTER) JOIN
  - returns all records from the right table, and the matched records from the left table
  
  SELECT column
  FROM table1
  RIGHT JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column;
  
FULL (OUTER) JOIN
  - returns all records when there is a match in either left or right table
  - can potentially return ver large result-sets!
  - FULL OUTER JOIN is the same as FULL JOIN
  
  SELECT column
  FROM table1
  FULL OUTER JOIN table2
  ON table1.column = table2.column
  WHERE condition;
  
SELF JOIN
  - a regular join, but the table is joined withi itself
  
  SELECT column
  FROM table1 T1, table1 T2 // T1 and T2 are different table aliases for the same table
  WHERE condition;
  
  e.g., matches customers that are from the same city
        SELECT A.CustomerName AS CustomerName1, B.CustomerName AS CustomerName2, A.City
        FROM Customer A, Customer B
        WHERE A.CustomerID <> B.CustomerID
        AND A.City = B.City
        ORDER BY A.City;
