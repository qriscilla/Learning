                        SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
            
                  use with IN to specify even further
                  e.g., SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20 AND NOT CategoryID IN (1,2,3);
            
                  e.g., products with a ProductName BETWEEN Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni (alphabetically)
                        SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'MOZZARELLA di Giovanni' ORDER BY ProductName;
            
                  between two dates (remember, inclusive!)

      IN          To specify multiple possible values for a column 
                  Is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions
            
                  e.g., SELECT column FROM table WHERE column IN (value1, value2);
            
                  e.g., all customers from the same countries as the suppliers
                        SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);

Other Operators
      AND       displays a record if ALL the conditions separated by AND are true
      OR        displays a record if ANY of the conditions separated by OR is true
      NOT       displays a record if the condition(s) is not true
                e.g., SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;

When combining operators, make sure to use parantheses with complex expressions.
  e.g., SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND (condition2 OR condition3);
