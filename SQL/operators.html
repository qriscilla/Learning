Other Operators
      AND       displays a record if ALL the conditions separated by AND are true
      OR        displays a record if ANY of the conditions separated by OR is true
      NOT       displays a record if the condition(s) is not true
                e.g., SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;

When combining operators, make sure to use parantheses with complex expressions.
  e.g., SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND (condition2 OR condition3);
