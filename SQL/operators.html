BETWEEN     Between a certain range
            values can be numbers, text, or dates
            is inclusive; begin and end values are included
            
            SELECT column FROM table WHERE column BETWEEN value1 AND value2;
            
            e.g., all products wih a price between 10 and 20
                  SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20;
            
            use with IN to specify even further
            e.g., SELECT * FROM Products WHERE Price BETWEEN 10 AND 20 AND NOT CategoryID IN (1,2,3);
            
            e.g., products with a ProductName BETWEEN Carnarvon Tigers and Mozzarella di Giovanni (alphabetically)
                  SELECT * FROM Products WHERE ProductName BETWEEN 'Carnarvon Tigers' AND 'MOZZARELLA di Giovanni' ORDER BY ProductName;
            
            between two dates (remember, inclusive!)
            e.g., SELECT * FROM Orders WHERE OrderDate BETWEEN '1996-07-01' AND '1996-07-31';
            
IN          To specify multiple possible values for a column 
            Is a shorthand for multiple OR conditions
            
            e.g., SELECT column FROM table WHERE column IN (value1, value2);
            
            e.g., all customers from the same countries as the suppliers
                  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE Country IN (SELECT Country FROM Suppliers);
            
LIKE        Search for a pattern
            (See notes on wildcards for more details)

AND         displays a record if ALL the conditions separated by AND are true
      
OR          displays a record if ANY of the conditions separated by OR is true
      
NOT         displays a record if the condition(s) is not true
            e.g., SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE NOT condition;
      
UNION       used to combine the result-set of two or more SELECT statements
            Each statement must have the smae number of columns
            Columns must have similar data types
            Columns must be in the same order
      
            SELECT column FROM table1
            UNION
            SELECT column FROM table2;
      
            UNION selects only distince values by default.
            use UNION ALL to allow duplicate values
      
            e.g., cities (only distinct ones) from Customers and Suppliers table
                  SELECT City FROM Customers
                  UNION
                  SELECT City FROM Suppliers
                  ORDER BY City;
      
            e.g., cities (including duplicates) from Customers and Suppliers table
                  SELECT City FROM Customers
                  UNION ALL
                  SELECT City FROM Supliers
                  ORDER BY City;

When combining operators, make sure to use parantheses with complex expressions.
  e.g., SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE condition1 AND (condition2 OR condition3);
