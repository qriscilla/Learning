SELECT
  - extracts data from database
  - e.g., SELECT column1 FROM table_name;

SELECT DISTINCT
  - extracts only distinct (different) values
  
SELECT TOP
  - used to specify the number of records to return
  - useful on large tables with thousands of records
    e.g., SELECT TOP number FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  - not all database systems support this command. MySQL uses LIMIT, and Oracle uses ROWNUM.
    e.g., The following three statements are the same:
          SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;
          SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 3;
          SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE ROWNUM <= 3;
  - top percent
    e.g., SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

SELECT INTO
  - copies data from one table into a new table

  e.g., copy all columns into a new table
        SELECT *
        INTO newtable [IN externaldatabase]
        FROM oldtable
        WHERE condition;
                                                   
  e.g., copy only some columns into a new table
        SELECT column1, column2, column3
        INTO newtable [IN externaldatabase]
        FROM oldtable
        WHERE condition;
                                                   
UPDATE
  - updates existing data in a database
  - use SET
  - use WHERE to update multiple fields
    e.g., UPDATE Contact SET ContactName='Juan' WHERE Country='Mexico';

DELETE
  - deletes data from a database
  - use WHERE to specify which record(s) you want deleted
    e.g., DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Ben Franklin';
  - without WHERE, you might delete all records in the table!
    e.g., DELETE FROM table_name;

INSERT INTO
  - inserts new data into a database
  - existing records in the target table are unaffected
                                                   
  INSERT INTO table2
  SELECT * FROM table1
  WHERE condition;                                                                       
                                                   
  2 ways:
    1. Specify both column names and values inserted 
        e.g., INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) 
              VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
    2. Only specify value names if they're being inserted into all columns 
        e.g., INSERT INTO table_name 
              VALUES (value1, value2, value3);

CREATE DATABASE
  - creates a new database

CREATE TABLE
  - creates a new table

CREATE PROCEDURE
  - create a procedure to reuse a code without typing it all out over and over again

  CREATE PROCEDURE procedure_name
  AS
  sql_statement
  GO;

  EXEC procedure_name;
            
  - use PROCEDURE with parameter(s)
            
  one parameter
      CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomer @City nvarchar(3)
      AS
      SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City
      Go;

      EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London';
            
  multiple parameters
      CREATE PROCEDURE SelectAllCustomers @City nvarchar(30), @PostalCode nvarchar(10)
      AS
      SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City = @City AND PostalCode = @PostalCode
      GO;

      EXEC SelectAllCustomers @City = 'London', @PostalCode = 'WA1 1DP';
            
ALTER DATABASE
  - modifies a database
  
ALTER TABLE
  - modifies a database

DROP TABLE
  - deletes a table

CREATE INDEX
  - creates an index (search key)

DROP INDEX
  - deletes an index

WHERE
  - used to filter records and extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition
  - e.g., SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
          UPDATE column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;

HAVING
  - used because WHERE can't be used with aggregate functions
                                                   
  SELECT column
  FROM table
  WHERE condition
  GROUP BY column
  HAVING condition
  ORDER BY column;
            
ORDER BY
  - used to sort the result-set in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order
  - is ascending by default
    e.g., SELECT column FROM table_name ORDER BY column ASC;
          SELECT column FROM table_name ORDER BY column DESC;
    e.g., SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY Country, CustomerName; // order by Country and then the same Country rows by CustomerName
    e.g., SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;

GROUP BY
  - gruops rows that have the same values into summary rows
  - often used with aggregate functions (COUNT, MAX, MIN, SUM, AVG) to group the result-set by one or more columns
      
  SELECT column
  FROM table_name
  WHERE condition
  GROUP BY column
  ORDER BY column; 
            
NULL
  - field with no value
  - different from zero or spaces! just left blank during record creation (whether it's on purpose or not)
  - can't test for NULL values with comparison operators (=, <, <>)
  - use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to test for NULL values
    e.g., SELECT column FROM table WHERE column IS NULL;

CASE
  - goes through conditions and returns a value when the first condition is met (like an IF-THEN-ELSE statement).
  - if a condition is true, it'll stop reading and return the result
  - if no condition is true, it'll return the value in the ELSE clause
  - if there's no ELSE part and no conditions are true, it'll return NULL

  CASE
    WHEN condition 1 THEN result1
    WHEN condition 2 THEN result2
    WHEN condition N THEN resultN
    ELSE result
  END;
