* all

SELECT
  - extracts data from database
  - e.g., SELECT column1 FROM table_name;

SELECT DISTINCT
  - extracts only distinct (different) values
  
SELECT TOP
  - used to specify the number of records to return
  - useful on large tables with thousands of records
    e.g., SELECT TOP number FROM table_name WHERE condition;
  - not all database systems support this command. MySQL uses LIMIT, and Oracle uses ROWNUM.
    e.g., The following three statements are the same:
          SELECT TOP 3 * FROM Customers;
          SELECT * FROM Customers LIMIT 3;
          SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE ROWNUM <= 3;
  - top percent
    e.g., SELECT TOP 50 PERCENT * FROM Customers;

UPDATE
  - updates existing data in a database
  - use SET
  - use WHERE to update multiple fields
    e.g., UPDATE Contact SET ContactName='Juan' WHERE Country='Mexico';

DELETE
  - deletes data from a database
  - use WHERE to specify which record(s) you want deleted
    e.g., DELETE FROM Customers WHERE CustomerName='Ben Franklin';
  - without WHERE, you might delete all records in the table!
    e.g., DELETE FROM table_name;

INSERT INTO
  - inserts new data into a database
  2 ways:
    1. Specify both column names and values inserted e.g., INSERT INTO table_name (column1, column2, column3) VALUES (value1, value2, value3);
    2. Only specify value names if they're being inserted into all columns e.g., INSERT INTO table_name VALUES (value1, value2, value3);

CREATE DATABASE
  - creates a new database

CREATE TABLE
  - creates a new table

ALTER DATABASE
  - modifies a database
  
ALTER TABLE
  - modifies a database

DROP TABLE
  - deletes a table

CREATE INDEX
  - creates an index (search key)

DROP INDEX
  - deletes an index

WHERE
  - used to filter records and extract only those records that fulfill a specified condition
  - e.g., SELECT column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
          UPDATE column1 FROM table_name WHERE condition;
                              
ORDER BY
  - used to sort the result-set in ascending (ASC) or descending (DESC) order
  - is ascending by default
    e.g., SELECT column FROM table_name ORDER BY column ASC;
          SELECT column FROM table_name ORDER BY column DESC;
    e.g., SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY Country, CustomerName; // order by Country and then the same Country rows by CustomerName
    e.g., SELECT * FROM customers ORDER BY Country ASC, CustomerName DESC;
                
NULL
  - field with no value
  - different from zero or spaces! just left blank during record creation (whether it's on purpose or not)
  - can't test for NULL values with comparison operators (=, <, <>)
  - use IS NULL and IS NOT NULL operators to test for NULL values
    e.g., SELECT column FROM table WHERE column IS NULL;
