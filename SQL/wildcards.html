      _     a single character
      []    any single character within the brackets
      ^     any character not in the brackets
      -     a range of characters

e.g., all customers with a City starting with any character followed by "ondon"
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '_ondon';

e.g., all customers with a City starting with "b", "s", or "p"
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '[bsp]%';

e..g, all customers with a City NOT starting with "b", "s", or "p"
  SELECT * FROM Customers WHERE City LIKE '[^bsp]%';
