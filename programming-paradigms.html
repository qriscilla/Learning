Each programming paradigm has its own rule for structuring your code to solve problems.

Functional Programming
- Invented in the 1950s, but is still very trendy
- Decomposes a problem into small / reusable functions that take some input and return a result
- Does not mutate or change data
- Good because: is concise, easy to debug and test, and is scalable
- Example languages: Clojure, Haskell, JavaScript (although not purely functional)
- Major concepts / terms:
  Higher-order functions
  Function Composition

Object-oriented Programming

Procedural Programming

Event-driven Programming
