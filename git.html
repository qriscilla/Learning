Git Overview      - A Version Control System (VCS) for tracking changes in computer files
                  - Distributed / de-centralized VCS; many developers can work on the same project without needing to be on the same network
                  - Takes "snapshots" of your files by making commits; tracks who made what changes and when
                  - Can stage files before committing
                  - Can revert back at any time
                  - Local changes can be pushed to repository
                
Basic Commands    Local Repository
                  $ git --version               Tells you what git version you have
                  $ git config                  (e.g., $ git config --global user.name 'Priscilla Whang')
                                                (e.g., $ git config --global user.email 'pri.whang@gmail.com')                  $ git init                Initialize local git repository; will create a .git folder in the project
                  $ touch <file>                (e.g., $ touch index.html) Creates a file
                  $ git rm --cached <file>      (e.g., $ git rm --cached index.html) Remove file
                  $ git status                  Checks status of working tree
                  $ git add <file>              Add file(s) to the staging area or the index
                  $ git add .                   Add all files to the staging area or the index
                  $ git commit                  Commit changes in index and pushes it to the local repository
                  $ git commit -m "<comment>"   Commit changes with comment, skipping the editing stage
                  
                  Remote Repository
                  $ git push                    Pushes local repository to remote repository
                  $ git pull                    Pull latest changes from remote repository
                  $ git clone                   Copy repository into the current directory

Git Ignore        - Use this for things you don't want to include in your repository

                  $ touch .gitignore            Creates gitignore file
                  
                  Examples    Say you have a file named log.txt that you don't want in your repository
                              In .gitignore, add the code log.txt, and it won't go into the repository
                              
                              Say you have a folder named dir2 that you don't want in your repository
                              In .gitignore, add the code /dir2, and it won't go into the repository
                              
                              Say you have a bunch of .txt files that you don't want in your repository
                              In .gitignore, add the code *.txt and all .txt files won't go into the repository
